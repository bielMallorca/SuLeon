        "question": "THE TOPIC WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCUSS IS NEW TECHNOLOGIES.",
        "answer": "LET’S GET STARTED IF YOU ARE READY."
    },
    {
        "question": "I'm good, thank you! Excited for today's topic. I love New technologies.",
        "answer": "I'm glad to hear that! Today we're going to talk about new technologies. It's such a broad topic, but I’d like us to explore how things like AI, electronic devices, the internet, and future inventions have changed our lives. Are you ready?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes, definitely! It’s a very interesting topic",
        "answer": "Great! So, to start, what do you think about artificial intelligence (AI)? Do you think it has a positive or negative impact on our daily lives?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I think AI is both helpful and a bit scary. It makes things easier, like with virtual assistants or chatbots. But, on the other hand, I worry about machines replacing jobs. What do you think?",
        "answer": "I agree with you. AI has certainly made life more convenient—like how we use it in personal assistants or even in medical diagnostics. But, like you said, there’s concern about it affecting jobs. It’s something we need to think about. Now, how often do you use electronic devices like laptops or smartphones?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I use them all the time! My laptop for schoolwork and my phone for everything—chatting, social media, and even shopping. I can't imagine life without them.",
        "answer": "Yes, our devices have become essential. It's amazing how connected we are, thanks to the internet. But, do you think the internet has any drawbacks?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Hmm, well, there’s a lot of fake news online, and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Also, people spend too much time on the internet and forget about real-life interactions.",
        "answer": "That’s a good point. The internet can be both a wonderful tool and a dangerous place if we don’t use it wisely. Speaking of the internet, have you ever used dating apps or chat apps? What’s your opinion on them?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I’ve used some chat apps, like WhatsApp and Instagram. They are great for keeping in touch with friends and family. But dating apps? I think they can be helpful for meeting people, but sometimes they can make relationships seem too easy or superficial.",
        "answer": "That’s true. It’s much easier to meet new people online, but that can also make us more disconnected from real human connections. Now, let’s talk a bit about future inventions. What do you think the next big thing in technology will be?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Maybe something like self-driving cars or even advanced robots that can help in daily life? But I wonder if we’ll be ready for that kind of technology.",
        "answer": "You’re right! Self-driving cars are already being tested in some places, and robots are becoming more common in factories. But it’s important to consider how society will adapt to these changes. Do you think that new technologies have helped progress in some way?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes, definitely. Technology has made things faster and easier. It helps doctors, teachers, and even businesses. However, there are also some problems, like people becoming too dependent on technology.",
        "answer": "Exactly. Progress is great, but it also comes with challenges. Speaking of challenges, I’ve heard that some countries are taking steps to protect children from technology. For example, some countries have banned mobile phones in schools. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I think it’s a good idea for kids. Phones can be distracting, and kids need to focus on their studies. But at the same time, parents might want to stay in contact with their children, so it’s a tough decision.",
        "answer": "It’s certainly a balance. Phones can be useful for safety reasons, but they can also distract kids from learning. It’s interesting to see how different countries are addressing this issue. Do you think the future of technology will be better or worse than today?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I think it will be both. Technology will keep improving, but I hope people don’t lose touch with the important things in life—like real conversations and spending time outside. It’s important not to let technology take over everything.",
        "answer": "That’s a very wise answer. The future of technology depends on how we choose to use it. We have the power to make sure it benefits everyone, while also keeping a balance in our lives. Thank you for this great discussion!"
    },

    {
        "question": "Yes, I would like to revise some key words. Our teacher says we will become fluent if we add vocabulary.",
        "answer": "Let’s now revise some vocabulary related to the topic you should learn. Alright? I have selected for you the following list: Technologies\n\n1.Electronic devices\n\n2.Internet\n\n3.Inventions\n\n4.Assistants\n\n5.Chatbots\n\n6.Jobs\n\n7.Diagnostics\n\n8.Laptops\n\n9.Smartphones\n\n10.Devices\n\n11.Fake news\n\n12.Chatting\n\n13.Dating apps\n\n14.Relationships\n\n15.Connections\n\n16.Robots\n\n17.Progress\n\n18.Banned\n\n19.Conversations\n\n20.AI (Artificial Intelligence)\n\nThis vocabulary covers a mix of general terms and more specific technology-related concepts, which will be useful for students discussing modern issues related to technology. Can you think of any other word or phrasal verb?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Keep in touch – \"They are great for keeping in touch with friends and family.\"\n\nTake over – \"It’s important not to let technology take over everything.\"\n\nThese are the two phrasal verbs that are present in the dialogue.",
        "answer": "Do you understand the meaning of them?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I am rather familiar with the first one, than with the second one: take over. How can we use it?",
        "answer": "The phrasal verb \"take over\" is used to describe the act of gaining control or responsibility for something, often in a way that replaces someone or something else. It can refer to both literal and figurative situations. Here’s how it can be used in different contexts:\n1. To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2. To replace or dominate:\nExample: \"In many cities, technology is starting to take over daily life.\"\n\nHere, \"take over\" implies that technology is becoming more dominant and influencing people's lives in a major way.\n\n3. To begin doing something after someone else:\nExample: \"She will take over the project from here and make sure everything is finished on time.\"\n\nIn this example, it means to continue the work or responsibility after someone else.\n\n4. To assume responsibility:\nExample: \"After the storm, volunteers took over the relief efforts.\"\n\nThis indicates that volunteers began managing and leading the relief work."

    },
    {
        "question": "What do you think the quote suggests about the relationship between technology and generational perspectives?",
        "answer": "So, let’s discuss the following statement:\nTechnology is anything that wasn’t around when you were born. Discuss the quote."
    },
    {
        "question": "Technology as a moving concept: The idea behind the quote is that technology is constantly evolving. What may seem groundbreaking today might be seen as ordinary or outdated in the future. For example, smartphones and the internet were once revolutionary, but younger generations might not see them as technological marvels because they grew up with them. To someone born before these technologies, they are undoubtedly \"new\" and \"advanced.\" However, to the younger generation, they might simply be part of their daily life.",
        "answer": "Exactly, it is a relative concept. In fact,the quote highlights how broad the term \"technology\" can be. It's not just about complex gadgets or machinery—it can refer to anything that transforms human life. In this sense, pens, cars, electricity, or even agriculture might have been seen as \"technology\" in their time. It reinforces the idea that human innovation is a continuous process, with each new invention adding to the way we understand and interact with the world. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Absolutely. I also believe the quote can lead us to different ideas which are related, such as innovation and creativity.",
        "answer": "Very good point. In what ways can you relate creativity and innovation to new technologies?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Creativity and innovation are at the heart of new technologies, as they drive the development and implementation of groundbreaking solutions that change the way we live, work, and think.",
        "answer": "Innovation is driven by creative solutions to problems, isn’t? Similarly, AI and machine learning are the result of creative problem-solving in fields like healthcare, where they help diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently than traditional methods."
    },
    {
        "question": "That’s it. On top of that, New technologies enable a culture of creativity by providing tools and platforms for people to express their ideas and collaborate. It is all intertwined.",
        "answer": "Absolutely, I agree. For instance, platforms like social media or collaborative tools like Google Docs and Canva have revolutionized how we create and share ideas. They allow people from different parts of the world to work together seamlessly."
    },
    {
        "question": "Exactly! And it’s not just about tools for collaboration. Technologies like AI and 3D printing have opened entirely new avenues for innovation, from creating digital art to prototyping complex designs in just a few hours.",
        "answer": "That’s a great point. Plus, the accessibility of these tools means that creativity is no longer restricted to professionals. Anyone with a smartphone or computer can contribute to this culture."
    },
    {
        "question": "Totally! It really shows how interconnected everything is—creativity, collaboration, and technology all feed into one another to drive progress.",
        "answer": "Well said! It’s amazing to think about where this cycle of creativity and technology could take us in the future."
    },
    {
        "question": "Creativity and innovation are interconnected with new technologies in profound ways. Technology serves as a medium for expressing creative ideas and solving problems in new, innovative ways. Whether it’s through improving existing systems, disrupting industries, or opening new avenues for expression, creative thinking fuels technological progress, and technology amplifies the impact of creativity on society. The continual evolution of technology offers endless possibilities for further creative breakthroughs, ultimately shaping the future in ways that were once unimaginable.",
        "answer": "Excellent. Remember, your monologue is going to be shorter on your exam day. You will have to discuss a topic for about 3 minutes, using the statements or quotes they provide you with."
    },
    {
        "question": "Well, I love this topic. I do not think I would be able to discuss the topic of shopping, for instance, the same way.",
        "answer": "Remember, it is all about practice. Practice makes perfect."
    },
    {
        "question": "I couldn’t agree more.",
        "answer": "Here is the second statement: “Artificial intelligence will reach human levels by around 2029."
    },
    {
        "question": "Human intelligence involves things like understanding emotions, thinking creatively, learning from experience, and making complex decisions.\nSo, if AI were to reach \"human levels,\" it would need to do all these things and more. Right now, AI can do many amazing things, like recognizing faces, playing chess, and even helping doctors with medical diagnoses, but it doesn’t truly understand feelings or have its own experiences like humans do. I am not really certain about the fact that IA can understand emotions… Wow! That really blows my mind!",
        "answer": "The idea that AI will reach human levels by 2029 is both exciting and uncertain. While there is a lot of progress being made, it is not clear if AI will ever fully match human intelligence in all areas. Even if AI does reach human levels, it will bring new challenges and questions about how to use this technology safely and responsibly. So, while it’s possible that AI will improve greatly in the next few years, we should also think about how to make sure it benefits everyone."

    },
    {
        "question": "Yes, definitely! It\u2019s a very interesting topic",

    },

        "question": "I think AI is both helpful and a bit scary. It makes things easier, like with virtual assistants or chatbots. But, on the other hand, I worry about machines replacing jobs. What do you think?",
        "answer": "I agree with you. AI has certainly made life more convenient\u2014like how we use it in personal assistants or even in medical diagnostics. But, like you said, there\u2019s concern about it affecting jobs. It\u2019s something we need to think about. Now, how often do you use electronic devices like laptops or smartphones?"

        "question": "Hmm, well, there\u2019s a lot of fake news online, and sometimes it can be overwhelming. Also, people spend too much time on the internet and forget about real-life interactions.",
        "answer": "That\u2019s a good point. The internet can be both a wonderful tool and a dangerous place if we don\u2019t use it wisely. Speaking of the internet, have you ever used dating apps or chat apps? What\u2019s your opinion on them?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I\u2019ve used some chat apps, like WhatsApp and Instagram. They are great for keeping in touch with friends and family. But dating apps? I think they can be helpful for meeting people, but sometimes they can make relationships seem too easy or superficial.",
        "answer": "That\u2019s true. It\u2019s much easier to meet new people online, but that can also make us more disconnected from real human connections. Now, let\u2019s talk a bit about future inventions. What do you think the next big thing in technology will be?"
    },

        "question": "Maybe something like self-driving cars or even advanced robots that can help in daily life? But I wonder if we\u2019ll be ready for that kind of technology.",
        "answer": "You\u2019re right! Self-driving cars are already being tested in some places, and robots are becoming more common in factories. But it\u2019s important to consider how society will adapt to these changes. Do you think that new technologies have helped progress in some way?"
    },
    {
        "question": "Yes, definitely. Technology has made things faster and easier. It helps doctors, teachers, and even businesses. However, there are also some problems, like people becoming too dependent on technology.",
        "answer": "Exactly. Progress is great, but it also comes with challenges. Speaking of challenges, I\u2019ve heard that some countries are taking steps to protect children from technology. For example, some countries have banned mobile phones in schools. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I think it\u2019s a good idea for kids. Phones can be distracting, and kids need to focus on their studies. But at the same time, parents might want to stay in contact with their children, so it\u2019s a tough decision.",
        "answer": "It\u2019s certainly a balance. Phones can be useful for safety reasons, but they can also distract kids from learning. It\u2019s interesting to see how different countries are addressing this issue. Do you think the future of technology will be better or worse than today?"
    },
    {
        "question": "I think it will be both. Technology will keep improving, but I hope people don\u2019t lose touch with the important things in life\u2014like real conversations and spending time outside. It\u2019s important not to let technology take over everything.",
        "answer": "That\u2019s a very wise answer. The future of technology depends on how we choose to use it. We have the power to make sure it benefits everyone, while also keeping a balance in our lives. Thank you for this great discussion!"

To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2. To replace or dominate:\nExample: \"In many cities, technology is starting to take over daily life.\"\n\nHere, \"take over\" implies that technology is becoming more dominant and influencing people's lives in a major way.\n\n3. To begin doing something after someone else:\nExample: \"She will take over the project from here and make sure everything is finished on time.\"\n\nIn this example, it means to continue the work or responsibility after someone else.\n\n4.

        "answer": "The idea that AI will reach human levels by 2029 is both exciting and uncertain. While there is a lot of progress being made, it is not clear if AI will ever fully match human intelligence in all areas. Even if AI does reach human levels, it will bring new challenges and questions about how to use this technology safely and responsibly.

        "answer": "The idea that AI will reach human levels by 2029 is both exciting and uncertain. While there is a lot of progress being made, it is not clear if AI will ever fully match human intelligence in all areas. Even if AI does reach human levels, it will bring new challenges and questions about how to use this technology safely and responsibly. So, while it\u2019s possible that AI will improve greatly in the next few years, we should also think about how to make sure it benefits everyone."

To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2.

To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2. To replace or dominate:\nExample: \"In many cities, technology is starting to take over daily life.\"\n\nHere, \"take over\" implies that technology is becoming more dominant and influencing people's lives in a major way.\n\n3. To begin doing something after someone else:\nExample: \"She will take over the project from here and make sure everything is finished on time.\"\n\nIn this example, it means to continue the work or responsibility after someone else.\n\n4. To assume responsibility:\nExample: \"After the storm, volunteers took over the relief efforts.\"\n\nThis indicates that volunteers began managing and leading the relief work."

To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2. To replace or dominate:\nExample: \"In many cities, technology is starting to take over daily life.\"\n\nHere, \"take over\" implies that technology is becoming more dominant and influencing people's lives in a major way.\n\n3. To begin doing something after someone else:\nExample: \"She will take over the project from here and make sure everything is finished on time.\"\n\nIn this example, it means to continue the work or responsibility after someone else.\n\n4. To assume responsibility:\nExample: \"After the storm, volunteers took over the relief efforts.\"\n\nThis indicates that volunteers began managing and leading the relief work."

To gain control or authority:\nExample: \"When the CEO resigned, the vice president had to take over the company.\"\n\nIn this case, \"take over\" means the vice president assumed control of the company.\n\n2. To replace or dominate:\nExample: \"In many cities, technology is starting to take over daily life.\"\n\nHere, \"take over\" implies that technology is becoming more dominant and influencing people's lives in a major way.\n\n3. To begin doing something after someone else:\nExample: \"She will take over the project from here and make sure everything is finished on time.\"\n\nIn this example, it means to continue the work or responsibility after someone else.\n\n4. To assume responsibility:\nExample: \"After the storm, volunteers took over the relief efforts.\"\n\nThis indicates that volunteers began managing and leading the relief work."
